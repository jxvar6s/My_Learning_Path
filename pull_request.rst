Now, we will create the pull request for the commit we just push up to the remote repository.

- let's Login into our github account. For the purpose of this demo, It is easier to use the web
  interface for clicking on the pull request bottom. image-1

- Let's go back to the <> Code tab section. In this section, we will see the README.rst file updated.

  * As long as we are contributor of the project, we will be able to create a pull request. if we are
    the maintainer or the owner of project then it will be the only way to make a merge.
